# ComfyUI Save File Extended — Cloud-friendly save/load & previews

Custom nodes for ComfyUI that extend the built-in Save and Preview Image/Video nodes. They add first-class cloud storage support, richer progress feedback, and a polished browser for large batches.

## Motivation

ComfyUI workflows generate many assets. Moving them off local disk and into shared buckets (S3/GCS/etc.) was clunky, and tracking progress for large uploads/downloads was opaque. This project makes cloud saves/loads feel native.

## Features

-   Save images/videos to local disk or popular cloud providers
-   Browse remote buckets with a clean, two-pane (Cloud/Local) UI
-   Preview images/videos with metadata
-   Real-time per-item and byte-level progress indicators
-   Replace default nodes drop-in; no workflow changes required

## Supported providers

-   S3-compatible (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Backblaze B2)
-   Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
-   Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive
-   FTP/SFTP, Supabase Storage, UploadThing

## Installation

Clone into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder and restart ComfyUI:

```bash
cd path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/bytes2pro/comfyui-save-file-extended.git
```

## Configuration

-   Provide credentials via the node UI or environment variables
-   Some providers require bucket/region configuration; see repo docs

## Usage

-   Replace default Save/Preview nodes with the extended variants
-   Choose Local or Cloud target; authenticate once, then browse and save
-   Watch the status panel for progress and errors

## Node documentation

Comprehensive docs for each included node are available in the repository’s documentation. See the README and docs folder:

## Roadmap

-   Chunked and resumable uploads for very large files
-   Folder sync and bulk operations
-   Advanced metadata tagging and search
